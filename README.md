## âœ¨ Key Features

Mentics has evolved to become a holistic platform for student success, incorporating a wide range of features to guide, motivate, and connect users.

### Core AI & Path Generation
* **Dual-Focus AI Paths**: Mentics offers two distinct, AI-driven journeys:
    * **Test Prep**: Generates a tailored study plan based on desired scores, strengths, weaknesses, and test dates.
    * **College Planning**: Creates a step-by-step guide for college applications, essays, and research, adapted to the student's grade level and goals.
* **Interactive Path Visualization**: An elegant and intuitive UI allows students to visualize their journey, click on nodes for task details, mark tasks as complete, and see their progress in real-time.
* **Dynamic Path Regeneration**: The AI can regenerate a user's path at any time based on their conversational input with the AI assistant, ensuring the plan always aligns with their evolving needs.
* **AI-Powered Essay Analysis**: A dedicated tool provides in-depth, constructive feedback on college essays, analyzing clarity, voice, structure, and grammar to help students refine their writing.

### User Engagement & Support
* **AI Assistant Chat**: An integrated chat feature, powered by Gemini, allows students to get "unstuck" at any time. It provides help on specific tasks, offers strategic advice, and saves conversation history for a continuous, context-aware experience.
* **Custom Tasks & Subtasks**: In addition to AI-generated tasks, users can add their own custom tasks to their path and break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
* **Stats & Progress Tracking**: A comprehensive dashboard where users can log their GPA and test scores. The **Tracker** page provides detailed charts to visualize score progression and review a complete history of all past study plans.
* **Proactive AI Encouragement**: The dashboard features an "AI Encouragement" card that provides personalized, motivational messages based on the user's recent activity, stats, and goals.

    * **Achievements**: Unlock achievements for reaching key milestones, such as completing a certain number of tasks or maintaining a long streak.
* **Leaderboard**: A public leaderboard showcases the top users based on points earned, fostering a sense of friendly competition.

### Account & Authentication
